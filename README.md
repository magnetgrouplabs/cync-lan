# THERE IS NOW A HASS *App* FOR THIS PROJECT!

Huge thanks to [@CodeNeedsCoffee](https://github.com/CodeNeedsCoffee) for the initial work on the App! For the foreseeable future, this project will stick with MQTT. The only way to create HASS devices is MQTT or an integration.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add App repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbaudneo%2Fhass-addons)

The existing `python` branch will remain for users who prefer a non HASS App setup.

Async HTTP/MQTT LAN controller for Cync/C by GE devices. **Local** only control
of **most** Cync devices via MQTT JSON payloads following the Home Assistant MQTT JSON schema. 
This project masquerades as the cloud server, allowing you to control your devices locally.

**This is a work in progress, and may not work for all devices.** 
See [known devices](docs/known_devices.md) for more information. Battery powered devices are currently *not* supported due to them being BTLE only.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (Walrus [:=] operator and `zoneinfo` built-in package used)
- A minimum of 1, non battery powered, Wi-Fi (*Direct Connect*) Cync / C by GE device to act as the TCP <-> BT bridge (always on)
- Cync account with devices added
- MQTT broker (I recommend EMQX)
- [Export devices](./docs/command_line_sub_commands.md#export) from the Cync cloud to a YAML file; first export requires account email, password and an OTP emailed to you
- [DNS override/redirection](./docs/DNS.md) for `cm.gelighting.com`, `cm-sec.gelighting.com` or `cm-ge.xlink.cn` to a local host that will run `cync-lan`
- **Non Docker:** [Create self-signed SSL certs](./docs/install.md#setup) using `CN=*.xlink.cn` for the server. You can use the `create_certs.sh` script
- **Optional:** *[Firewall](#firewall) rules to allow cync devices to talk to `cync-lan`* **(VLANs?)**

>[!NOTE]
> You still need to use your Cync account to add new devices as you acquire them.

---

## Installation
>[!IMPORTANT]
> You must visit http://localhost:23778 in order to export your Cync devices from the Cync 
> cloud API. Even if you only plan on using a docker set-up. This requires your email, 
> password and the code that will be emailed to you during export.

>[!TIP]
> Existing `cync_mesh.yaml`? simply use the config as it is, via cli or bind mount into the docker container.

If you add new devices to your  Cync account, you need to export the config. Please see [Install docs](./docs/install.md)
for more information.

### Updating Docker Container
#### Updating using a new image
- `cd` to cync-lan docker directory where `docker-compose.yaml` is located
- run: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d --force-recreate`

---

## Re-routing / Overriding DNS
>[!WARNING] 
> After freshly redirecting DNS: Devices that are currently
> talking to Cync cloud will need to be power cycled before they make
> a DNS request and connect to the local `cync-lan` server.

There are detailed instructions for OPNSense and Pi-hole. 
See [DNS docs](docs/DNS.md) for more information.

## Tips
See [Tips](docs/tips.md) for more information on how to get the most out of this project.

Also, let me set some expectations:
1. HASS light groups will always have a delay on state changes between each other (set group of cync lights green, they don't all change to green at the same time) 
At the moment, the script receives an MQTT command, sends commands to `x` devices 
and receives a `success` response all within 200 ish ms (0.2 seconds). I don't know
what happens on the device itself, but the TCP <-> BT bridge is not instant, when it really should be. Work continues on improving this.
2. There are no provisions for the Cync app to work with this project, any data sent by the app is black-holed (for now, anyway).
3. If I dont own a device, I cant test it, and if I cant test it, I cant support it. If you want a device supported, you will need to set-up a debug env and send me logs of the device communicating with the cloud server, or you can buy the device and send it to me. See [Buy devices to be supported](#buy-devices-to-be-supported) for more information.

## Config file
See the example [config file](./cync_mesh_example.yaml)

### Export config from Cync cloud API

#### **NEW** Web App
By default, the export webserver is started when cync-lan is. Navigate to http://localhost:23778 to access the export web app.
It is the exact same as in the HASS *App*.

#### CLI
There is an `export` [sub command](./docs/command_line_sub_commands.md#export) 
that is interactive and will query the Cync cloud API, export all home and each homes devices to a YAML file.

---

## CLI arguments
You can always supply `--help` to the cync-lan.py script to get a 
breakdown. Please see the 
[sub-command docs](./docs/command_line_sub_commands.md) for more information.

## Env Vars
> [!NOTE]
> The `CYNC_MQTT_URL` variable is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release.
> For now, it will be parsed into `CYNC_MQTT_HOST`, `CYNC_MQTT_PORT`, `CYNC_MQTT_USER`, and `CYNC_MQTT_PASS`.

## Controlling devices
Devices are controlled by JSON MQTT messages. This was designed to be used 
with Home Assistant, but you can use any MQTT client to send messages 
to the MQTT broker.

**Please see [Home Assistant MQTT documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/#json-schema) 
for more information on JSON payloads.** This repo will try to stay up to
date with the latest Home Assistant MQTT JSON schema.

## Home Assistant
Cync-LAN uses the MQTT discovery mechanism in Home Assistant to 
automatically add devices. You can control the Home Assistant MQTT 
topic via the environment variable `CYNC_HASS_TOPIC` (default: `homeassistant`).

## Debugging / socat
If your devices are not responding to commands, it's likely that the TCP
communication on the device is different. You can either open an issue 
and I can walk you through getting good debug logs, or you can use 
`socat` to inspect (MITM) the traffic of the device communicating with the 
cloud server in real-time yourself by running:

```bash
# make sure to create the self-signed certs first (they will be located in ./certs/ dir)
# Older firmware devices
socat -d -d -lf /dev/stdout -x -v 2> dump.txt ssl-l:23779,reuseaddr,fork,cert=certs/server.pem,verify=0 openssl:34.73.130.191:23779,verify=0
# Newer firmware devices (Notice the last IP change)
sudo socat -d -d -lf /dev/stdout -x -v 2> dump.txt ssl-l:23779,reuseaddr,fork,cert=certs/server.pem,verify=0 openssl:35.196.85.236:23779,verify=0
```
In `dump.txt` you will see the back-and-forth communication between the device and the cloud server.
`>` is device to server, `<` is server to device.

# Firewall
Once the devices are local, they must be able to initiate a connection to 
the `cync-lan` server. If you block them from the internet, don't forget to 
allow them to connect to the `cync-lan` server (VLANs?).

## OPNsense Example
Please see the [example](./docs/troubleshooting.md#opnsense-firewall-example)
in the troubleshooting docs.

# Power cycle devices after DNS re-route
Devices make a DNS query on first startup (or after a network loss,
like AP reboot) - you need to power cycle all devices that are currently 
connected to the Cync cloud servers before they request a new DNS record 
and will connect to the local `cync-lan` server.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having issues, please see the 
[Troubleshooting docs](docs/troubleshooting.md) for more information.

# Buy devices to be supported
If you really want a device added, [purchase it from this Amazon wish list](https://www.amazon.ca/registries/gl/guest-view/270SHDZQLXRU8), 
and it will be sent to me. I will add support ASAP.
